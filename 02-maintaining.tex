    \begin{itemize}
      \item Installing and managing R and its extensions can be pretty 
complicated\dots
      \item If printed, the 
\href{http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html}{R 
Installation and Administration} manual would run over 100 pages.
      \item We don't have that kind of time.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Highlights}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Problem: you want to maintain separate package libraries.
      \item You can always specify which library a package loads from: \\
\texttt{library("foo", lib.loc="mylib/")}
      \item But what if you have a lot of packages to load\dots
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{Highlights}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{.libPaths()} ``gets/sets the library trees within which 
packages are looked for''.
      \item So if you have package \texttt{foo} in libraries \texttt{A} and 
\texttt{B}, setting \texttt{.libPaths(B)} will put \texttt{B} in the search 
path before \texttt{A}.
      \item Meaning package \texttt{foo} will load from library \texttt{B} (and 
R will look there first even if it's not installed there).
      \item \texttt{.Library} and \texttt{.Library.site} also exist, but are 
more specialized.
      \item \texttt{update.packages()} also exists.
  \end{itemize}
